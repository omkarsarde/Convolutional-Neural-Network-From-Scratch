# Convolutional Neural Network From Scratch
 A Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation to demonstrate importance of Kernel Size and Batch Norm through visualization of Convolutional Filters and Feature Layer Maps. The aim of this project is to understand the underpinnings of a CNN model, effectively deciphering models form the most rudimentary to State of the Art architectures.

# Feature Layer Maps and Filter
A feature map is basically the result of applying a Convulational Filter on an image. A Convolutional Filter can be summarized as the weights learned after "Convolution" {Fancy term for summing nearby pixels}
